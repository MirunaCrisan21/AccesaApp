# Miruna's weather app

A weather application for Accesa internship.

The app fulfills all the requirements presented in the email. It allows the user to forecast up to 5 days and 24h and it allows the search of any city. Also, I added a star favorite button to be able to save the desired cities. The user searches the city, presses the star button near it and the location will be saved in a favorite list accesible whenever the yellow star button is pressed. The app also includes five different themes which will be automatically set depending on the current weather.
